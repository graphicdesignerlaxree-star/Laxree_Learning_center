Task: Fix YouTube videos in Product Academy

Work Log:
- Verified VIDEO_LESSONS array has correct YouTube IDs matching user's provided links
- Updated database modules with contentUrl (YouTube embed URLs) for all 9 video modules
- Modified lesson-viewer.tsx to embed YouTube videos via iframe when contentUrl is provided
- Created smart-proxy.js to wrap the Next.js server with auto-restart and connection management
- Created watcher.sh for process monitoring and restart
- Updated .env with correct DATABASE_URL for Neon PostgreSQL

Stage Summary:
- All 9 video modules in the database now have YouTube embed URLs
- Lesson viewer now shows embedded YouTube player above the interactive lesson content
- Server stability solution: smart-proxy.js + watcher.sh for auto-restart
- The server environment kills processes periodically; the watcher script mitigates this
- Key video mappings: Safe Box=St815eDtI5c, RFID=ltARwWOPn6Q, Minibar=Z-eOuzqM0ns, etc.

Task: Remove content below video in Watch tab - keep ONLY YouTube embed

Work Log:
- Read lesson-viewer.tsx to understand the Watch tab structure
- Found that Watch tab contained InteractiveLessonPlayer below the YouTube iframe (lines 1057-1063)
- The InteractiveLessonPlayer showed: "Interactive Video Lesson" badge, duplicate module title, Key Takeaways, and other content below the video
- Removed the InteractiveLessonPlayer component call from the Watch tab entirely
- Watch tab now shows ONLY the YouTube iframe (with a "Video not available" fallback if no contentUrl)
- Committed and pushed to GitHub (commit 706c1fe)
- Attempted browser verification but the dev server environment is extremely unstable (server dies within seconds)
- Confirmed via curl that port 3000 serves correct Next.js HTML with all script tags
- The Z.ai platform gateway serves a loading page because it can't detect the server as healthy due to the environment instability

Stage Summary:
- Watch Video tab now contains ONLY the YouTube embed - no extra text, no "Interactive Video Lesson" badge, no duplicate titles, no content below
- Code change committed and pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/graphicdesignerlaxree-star/Laxree_Learning_center
- Changes will be visible on Vercel deployment (stable environment)
- Local browser verification blocked by environment instability (dev server killed within seconds)
